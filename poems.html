        <h2 id="sunday-morning"> Sunday Morning</h2>
  
        <p> On the couch that is colored brown, <br>
            a boy named George starts to lie down. <br>
            With no planned agenda in sight, <br>
            he longs to watch T.V ‘til night. <br>
  
        <p> Grabbing the remote and turning it on, <br>
            while his dog stares from the grassy lawn, <br>
            he flips through the channels one by one <br>
            as the roof above shields him from the sun. <br>

        <p> Click until he has arrived at his favorite show, <br>
            as children on the T.V shout “Joe Schmo!” <br>
            George relaxes as he sits down on his behind, <br>
            with no worries in his adolescent mind. <br>

        <p> He sinks into his seat, slouchy and slow, <br>
            as his brain buries into a slumber of low. <br>
            His mom walks into the sleeping den to bid <br>
            wishing that she could go back as a kid. <br>
          
         
        <h2 id="other-side"> The Other Side </h2>
  
        <p> Waiting for his Princess on the other side of the world, <br>
            the man longs for a partner whom he can kiss <br>
            while the sun rises above the tranquil sea. <br>
            Peonies blossom and tulips bloom with grace, <br>
            pouring through every crevasse of the land like the desires in his heart. <br>
            Picking up the ruby red rose, <br>
            smelling the scent of irresistible romance, <br>
            shutting his lustful eyes, <br>
            he transcends into a magical fantasy of sensation and beauty. <br>
 
        <p id="nice-one"> He dreams, <br>
		 “of.…. <br>
         ...love” <br>
         , she dreams. <br> </p>
	    

        <p id="second-half"> She stares up at the shimmering night sky, <br>
        catching a shooting star in the distance. <br>
        Closing her delighted eyes, <br>
        ones that sparkle bubbles of champagne, <br> 
        taking a deep breath of the cold breeze, <br>
        she makes a wish for a passionate lover. <br>
        While the sun sets into a peaceful sleep, <br>
        the woman waits for him to rescue her from episodes of loneliness,<br>
        as her Prince Charming wakes up on the other side of the world. </p>

        <h2 id="dear-shrek"> Dear Shrek </h2>
  
        <p> You live a life of wonder; <br>
        it really makes me ponder <br>
        since your spectacular story <br>
        is filled with glitz and glory. <br>

        <p> You taught to never judge a book by its cover <br>
        and seek personality over looks in a lover. <br>
        Oh how thankful we are for your bravery<br>
        as you are for a feast that is savory.<br>

        <p> You prove that you are not a betrayer<br>
        by relating to an onion with many layers - <br>
        a metaphor that touches our hearts<br>
        in a way that will never grow apart.<br>

        <p> You have a loving wife<br>
        whom you would save under a knife,<br>
        What an ideal relationship goal - <br>
        a companionship without any holes.<br>

        <p> Your actions prove you to be<br>
        a man of gallant glee.<br>
        Your acts of kindness stand out<br>
        as you do not pretend or pout.<br>

        <p> You provided our lives with laughter,<br>
        from Shrek I to Forever After.<br>
        I wish I could shake your hand,<br>
        but I would have to travel to your land.<br>

        <p> You are never, ever stingy<br>
        with your companions like Gingy<br>
        By defeating Lord Farquaad,<br>
        you are very much our God.<br>

        <p> And so I leave with a final thought - <br>
        I thank you for lots and lots<br>
        as your life is filled with sublime<br>
        once upon a Shrek time.<br>
  
        <h4 id="black-box">The Black Box That Swings </h4>
  
        <img id="swing" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Joean_Honoré_Fragonard_-_The_Swing.jpg/1200px-Joean_Honoré_Fragonard_-_The_Swing.jpg" alt="swing" height="400">

        <p> The girl tenses <br>
        as her arms grasp onto the metal chains,<br>
        while she swings back into depression<br>
        with the black box that confines her.<br>


        <p> Black above the girl,<br>
        like a dark ceiling<br>
        hanging under gloomy clouds,<br>
        shielding her from the sun,<br>
        as it sucks the life out of her,<br>
        breath by breath.<br>

        <p> Black below the girl,<br>
        like a marble tiled floor <br>
        that divides her from the ground,<br>
        having no foundation<br>
        to help her reach for the skies.<br>

        <p> Black to the left, right, front, back of the girl,<br>
        like four walls<br>
        preventing her from escaping the nightmare,<br>
        as she is trapped<br>
        inside the imaginary black box.<br>

        <img id="depression" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Grieving_shadow.jpg/640px-Grieving_shadow.jpg" alt="depression" height="380">

        <div id="queen-box"> <p> Whoosh!

        <p> The girl returns back to reality <br> 
        as she sways back and forth  <br> 
        on the swing set, <br> 
        reassured that she is free from terror. <br> 

        <p> Letting go of her loath,  <br> 
        flying towards freedom, <br> 
        and screaming with satisfaction, <br> 
        she escapes the imaginary black box  <br> 
        for a mere minute. <br> 
 
        <p> But as she returns back to the ground <br> 
        with the euphoria long gone, <br> 
        the girl starts to regret her life, <br> 
        tumbling into a deep haze of horror. <br> 

        <p> The girl tenses <br> 
        as her arms grasp onto the metal chains, <br> 
        while she swings back into depression <br> 
        with the black box that confines her.</div>

       <div class="final-poem"> <h2 id="finish-line"> ~ The Finish Line ~ </h2>
       <p> From the transparent skies, <br>
       from the harp of sound, <br>
       from the gift of light, <br>
       we are given a life to explore. <br>
       Take in every breath, <br>
       Take in every breath, <br>
       savor every dish, <br>
       taste every snowflake that falls down <br>
       on a cold winter’s night. <br>
       Life is a symphony of quiet and mystery -  <br>
       quiet like the wind breeze,  <br>
       a deafening silence that you can see;<br>
       mystery like the tranquil poke of a needle<br>
       as it sends the patient to a deep doze.<br>
       But light exchanges with dark - <br>
       darkness that swells inside the heart<br>
       like a balloon ready to pop;<br>
       it pops with hatred and shame.<br>
       Yet we can all make the most -<br>
       the most out of life,<br>
       the most out of a week,<br>
       the most out of a day,<br>
       the most out of every second.<br>
       One day,<br>
       our existence will be nothing <br>
       but a glimpse of<br>
       memory within someone’s brain.<br>
  
       <p> It is time to take control of our lives <br>
       and seek what we desire <br>
       as we draw closer to the finish line.<br>
       How we make the most of our time<br>
       is in our power - <br>
       go on that walk with your family,<br>
       tell them you love them,<br>
       visit the Seven Wonders,<br>
       Life is harmonious,<br>
       with happy segments of laugh,<br>
       yet episodes of grief. <br>
       Today we can turn the end <br>
       into a new beginning --<br>
       beginnings filled with memories.<br>
       Turn the sadness into happiness,<br>
       turn the anger into smiles,<br>
       turn the hate into love.<br>
       As we reflect the moon’s darkness,<br>
       transform it into a mystical fantasy of light.<br>
       Shine the world with one’s legacy<br>
       as we glow with the sparks that carry us.<br>
       Carrying sparks,<br>
       carrying stories,<br>
       carrying emotions,<br>
       we race to the finish line.<br> </div>
