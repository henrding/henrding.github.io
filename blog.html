        <p class="cool-entry">Today was my first day of freshman year. I was excited but also disappointed that everything was online, so I couldn’t see my friends. I attended my virtual classes and realized I am in for a wild ride. In biology class, we had to describe ourselves in one word; I said I was introverted. I was hesitant to answer questions in English because I was scared to speak up. I feel like I had good ideas when we talked about Breaking Through, but my voice died down. I mean, my camera was off anyways. I also hate the way I look; I think I should go on a diet because my parents say I’m obese. I don’t think this is a good way of expressing myself, but what more can I do? I want to have a fun life, but I feel so confined to my room. Quarantine is making me go crazy. I want a high school life where I can experience and make new friends, not just lay in bed all day. Anyways, that was my first day of high school. I hope it gets better from here because my truth is negative and hidden from others.</p>
        <h2 id="entry-two"> Entry #2</h2>

        <p class="cool-entry"> Today is one of the last days of sophomore year. As I improve on specific qualities like speaking up, I still feel down on some days. The truth is that people often overlook me to the point where I feel like I am not good enough. At times I hate myself because I seem to have no purpose whatsoever but a standing background. I can be insecure about myself and say that I wouldn’t change anything when I would change many things. On days, I would change the way I walk, look, and everything in between. As selfish as this may sound, I am ultimately hurting myself through demoralizing myself in a way that I wish I could just embrace. A dark truth can simultaneously exist with my self-growth.


<p class="cool-entry"> On the bright side, I realize that my insecurities from my past have shaped me into the person I am today, both good and bad. Whereas I once was a shy kid who wouldn’t take chances, I now embrace my shyness to slowly dive into new opportunities. For example, I was able to befriend many people in my classes this year, like the boys. Gaining a sense of independence and confidence has boosted me to seek the exposure I needed. In terms of my self-image, staying positive is a commitment that I am guilty of falling short of. I realized that I have to accept myself in order for others to do the same. Throughout the past months, I have exposed my truth in raw emotions that are being transformed for the better. Being introverted is something I am not ashamed about, as I have come to terms that I need to be vulnerable and open to others in order to share the memories I hope to acquire. I have also come to realize that my shyness only hinders my ability to emotionally and socially develop to a certain extent. 
<p class="cool-entry"> The past two years have shaped who I am today since I have gathered notions on what not to repeat upon my awkward self. Being shy might never go away from my personality, but I try to look through myself with optimism and accept who I am. To my freshman self, I want you to know that you can make it. You are worthy of success and deserve every ounce of strength. You are stronger than you think you are, except for the hair you cut yourself. The truth is always within you, and you have to make the most of it. So here I am today, staying true to who I really am because I recognize that I am a human deserving of experiencing life without being in the background of every situation. And to my future self as a senior, I hope you can build your life off of the truth and turn it into an even better agenda to live by. As I continue to trudge through high school, I will look with optimism since we are, as Bon Jovi says, more than “halfway there and livin on a prayer”. </p>
